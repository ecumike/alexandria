## Install Requirements

Python 3.8 ish +

Postgres 11 ish +

## Install

Setup a virtual environment:

&nbsp; &nbsp; `python3 -m venv /path/to/env/<name>`

&nbsp; &nbsp; or

&nbsp; &nbsp; `virtualenv -p python3 /path/to/python-env/<name>`


Activate that environment:

&nbsp; &nbsp; `source /path/to/env/<name>/bin/activate`


Clone the repo:

&nbsp; &nbsp; `git clone git@github.com:ibm/omnia.git`


CD to the repo root wherever you just cloned it to and install the dependencies:

&nbsp; &nbsp; `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Setup some localhost variables:
There are some local variables and settings needed for your implementation. They can either be set as environment variables, or you can add a `local_settings.py` file alongside the Django default `settings.py` file. 
If you set them as environment variables you will only have to do this once and each of our Django app will use those same settings.

You only need to replace the two `___`s with your local Postgres DB user ID and PW. 
`SCRIPT_NAME` is intentionally blank.


```
    export DJANGO_DB_USER=____
    export DJANGO_DB_PASSWORD=____
    export DJANGO_DEBUG_FLAG=True
    export DJANGO_FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME=
```
    
Create a postgresql database called `omnia`
(Ensure your user account can write to the database)


Have Django setup the database according to the models. From the repo root:

&nbsp; &nbsp; `./manage.py migrate`

Create a superuser (follow the prompts, you can leave email blank):

&nbsp; &nbsp; `./manage.py createsuperuser`

## Running and developing

Every time you want to start the app, there are 3 steps:
1. Ensure you are in your environment you created above.
2. CD to the local repo root.
3. Start up Django.
 
Steps in detail: 

1. Ensure you have the environment activated:

&nbsp; &nbsp; `source /path/to/env/<name>/bin/activate`

2. CD to the repo root:

&nbsp; &nbsp; `cd /some/path/to/repo`

3. Start the Django app:

&nbsp; &nbsp; `./manage.py runserver`

Now you can open your browser to http://localhost:8000/  and you should see it.

Make your changes and simply reload your browser page to see them


### Uploads
For research file uploads, you need COS/S3 (Cloud Object Storage) setup and vars set in `settings.py`


### Pro tip
Create a script alias to do all this for you. Add this line in your `.bash_profile` file:

`alias startomnia'source /path/to/this-app-env/bin/activate && cd /some/path/to/repo/ && ./manage.py runserver'`


## Documentation
We use `pydoctor` (https://pydoctor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for easy to read auto-generated documentation.
You can generate easily for any installed app.
1. Install pydoctor:  `pip install pydoctor`
2. Run pydoctor to generate HTML files for whichever app you want. Example:  `pydoctor --make-html --html-output=docs/metrics metrics`
3. Open the `docs/metrics/index.html` file in your browser and read away.
