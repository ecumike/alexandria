# Web site

All web site pages are just templates in templates/info. Pretty straight-forward.

The views control what breadcrumb shows up and which left nav is highlighted in the `info/page_template.html` file

## FAQs
FAQs are managed via the Admin Center. In there you setup categories and then create FAQs and select what categories they go/apply to (can be more than 1). HTML pass-thru is setup.

## Release notes
These are managed via the Admin Center.
